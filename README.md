## Explore
Try it out by installing the requirements. (Works only with python >= 3.8, due to Django 4)

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a database schema:

    python manage.py migrate

And then start the server (default: http://localhost:8000)

    python manage.py runserver


Now you can browse the [API](http://localhost:8000/api/)
or start on the [landing page](http://localhost:8000/)
